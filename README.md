# IACV-Homework-24-25

Welcome to the **IACV-Homework-24-25** repository! This project involves **image analysis and computer vision techniques** to reconstruct a 3D scene from a given image.

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to extract and compute key geometric properties from the image scene, including:
- Determining the **vanishing line** (*l′∞*) of the horizontal plane.
- Computing the **Euclidean rectification mapping** (*HR*) and the **depth (m)** of the parallelepiped.
- Estimating the **camera calibration matrix (K)**.
- Measuring the **height (h)** of the parallelepiped.
- Extracting the **X-Y coordinates** of a dozen points on surface *S*.
- Determining the **camera’s location in world coordinates**.
